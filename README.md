# 🔺 3D Polygon Prism Visualizer

This project allows you to visualize and animate 3D prisms with a user-defined number of polygonal sides (from 3 to 12). The script uses Python, matplotlib, and numpy to generate and animate the prisms, allowing you to export the animation as a .gif or .mp4.

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    
bash
```
git clone https://github.com/SergKhachikyan/Python_Visualization.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    
bash
```
cd visualization
```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
    Make sure Python 3.x is installed, then run:
    
bash
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Launch the project:**
    Run the script:
    
bash
```
python main.py
```

## 🔧 Technologies

This project uses the following technologies:
- **Python** 🐍: Programming language.
- **Matplotlib** 📊: Visualization library for generating 3D plots.
- **NumPy** 🔢: Numerical computations for creating geometric shapes.
- **Pillow** 🖼: For .gif export.
- **FFmpeg** 🎥: For .mp4 export.

## 📝 How to Use

1. **Run the script:**
    - Open a terminal and run the script:
      
bash
```
python main.py
```

2. **Input the number of sides:**
    - You'll be prompted to enter a number between 3 and 12 (e.g., 5 for a pentagonal prism).

3. **Save the animation:**
    - To save the rotating animation as a .gif or .mp4, you can modify the code:
      
python
      draw_rotating_prism(n, save_as_gif=True)  # Saves as .gif
      draw_rotating_prism(n, save_as_gif=False) # Saves as .mp4


## 💡 Features

- **Visualize 3D Prisms** 🔺: Supports prisms with 3 to 12 polygonal sides.
- **Rotation Animation** 🎞: Rotates the 3D prism and allows for saving the animation.
- **Export Animation** 💾: Save as .gif or .mp4.

## 📊 Visualizations

- **Rotating Prism**: Watch the prism rotate around the vertical axis for an animated effect.
- **Geometry**: The script allows you to visualize prisms with varying polygonal sides, including triangles, squares, pentagons, and more.
